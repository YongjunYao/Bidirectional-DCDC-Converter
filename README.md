# Bidirectional-DCDC-Converter

Welcome to visit my personal project.
This is a DCDC converter converting voltage from 12V to 240V or from 240V to 12V.

In the project, what I finished and will present includes:
1.A parameter caculator written in C++ to help decide the parameter of the most important component, the coil or the inductor;
2.A boost(12V -> 240V) controller written in C, running on STM32F103;
3.A sheet of schematic.
